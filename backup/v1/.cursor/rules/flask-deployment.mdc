# Flask Deployment Rules v1.0.0

## Overview

Development rules for flask focusing on deployment best practices.


## Examples

### ✅ GOOD: Proper flask pattern

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get('/health')
def health():
    return {'status': 'ok'}
```

### ❌ AVOID: Anti-pattern

```python
# Avoid global state and side effects at import time
app = None  # no real app created
```


## Restrictions

- ❌ Follow framework conventions
- ❌ Write tests for all features
- ❌ Document complex logic
